## üõ†Ô∏è Commands to Add Cars

### Option 1: Bulk Addition (Recommended)
Add all cars at once using the bulk endpoint:

```bash
cd backend
npm run add-cars-bulk
```

### Option 2: Individual Addition
Add cars one by one (useful for debugging):

```bash
cd backend
npm run add-cars
```

### Option 3: Using cURL Commands

#### Add a single car:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cars \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Porsche 911",
    "brand": "Porsche",
    "price": 200,
    "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1503376780353-7e6692767b70?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80",
    "description": "Iconic sports car with exceptional performance",
    "category": "Sports",
    "transmission": "Manual",
    "seats": 4,
    "fuelType": "Petrol"
  }'
```

#### Add multiple cars at once:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cars/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @utils/sampleCars.json
```

### Option 4: Using Postman or Similar Tools

1. **Single Car Addition**:
   - Method: `POST`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/cars`
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Body (raw JSON):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Porsche 911",
     "brand": "Porsche",
     "price": 200,
     "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1503376780353-7e6692767b70?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80",
     "description": "Iconic sports car with exceptional performance",
     "category": "Sports",
     "transmission": "Manual",
     "seats": 4,
     "fuelType": "Petrol"
   }
   ```

2. **Bulk Addition**:
   - Method: `POST`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/cars/bulk`
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Server not running**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Database connection issues**:
   - Check your MongoDB connection string in `.env`
   - Ensure MongoDB is running

3. **Duplicate cars**:
   - The system allows duplicate cars
   - Use the delete endpoint if needed: `DELETE /api/cars/:carId`

4. **Image loading issues**:
   - All images are from Unsplash CDN
   - Check your internet connection
   - Images are optimized for web delivery

### Verification Commands:

Check if cars were added successfully:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cars
```

Get cars by category:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/cars/filter?category=Sports"
```

## üéØ Next Steps

After adding cars:
1. Visit your frontend at `http://localhost:5000` (or your frontend port)
2. Browse the cars in different categories
3. Test the booking and payment flow
4. Try the filters (category, price, transmission)

## üìù Notes

- All cars start as available (not booked)
- Images are served from Unsplash CDN for optimal performance
- Car data includes all required fields for the rental system
- The bulk addition is faster and recommended for initial setup
